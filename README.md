How It Works
1. Fetching Data from the API
The project fetches categories and questions from an external API.

Category Data
The API endpoint for fetching categories is:

bash
Copy
Edit
GET https://rithm-jeopardy.herokuapp.com/api/categories?count=[**integer**]
Replace **integer** with the number of categories you want to fetch (e.g., 100 categories).

Question Data
To retrieve questions for a specific category, use the following endpoint:

bash
Copy
Edit
GET https://rithm-jeopardy.herokuapp.com/api/category?id=[**integer**]
Replace **integer** with the category ID you want to fetch questions for.

Game Instructions
When you open the game, you will see a list of categories.

Click on a category to see the available questions for that category.

Each question will display the "Question" and the "Answer" once clicked.

You can continue exploring other categories and their questions by clicking on them.
